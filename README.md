# Real-Estate-Home-Price-Prediction
I tested my Machine Learning skills to test in this project.
First I built the model using sklearn and machine learning algorithm using Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. 
Second step was to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component was the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
During model building I came across all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc.

<h2>Technologies used:</h2>
Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
